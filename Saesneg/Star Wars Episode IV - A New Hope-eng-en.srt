1
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,830
Did you hear that?
They've shut down the main reactor.

2
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,970
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness!

3
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,980
We're doomed!

4
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,650
There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.

5
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,790
What's that?

6
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,360
R2-D2, where are you?

7
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,430
At last! Where have you been?

8
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,200
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

9
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,650
We'll be sent to the spice mines of
Kessel or smashed into who knows what!

10
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,970
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

11
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,640
The Death Star plans are
not in the main computer.

12
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,620
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?

13
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,380
What have you done with those plans?

14
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,830
We intercepted no transmissions.

15
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,450
Aaah....This is a consular ship.
Were on a diplomatic mission.

16
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,220
If this is a consular ship...
were is the Ambassador?

17
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,260
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans

18
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,350
and bring me the Ambassador.
I want her alive!

19
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,830
There she is! Set for stun!

20
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,170
She'll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

21
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,560
Hey, you're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

22
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,360
You'll be deactivated for sure.

23
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,720
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease!

24
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,380
Now come out before somebody sees you.

25
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,840
Secret mission? What plans?
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there!

26
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm going to regret this.

27
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,730
-There goes another one.
-Hold your fire. There are no life forms.
It must have been short-circuited.

28
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,960
That's funny, the damage doesn't
look as bad from out here.

29
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,670
Are you sure this things safe?

30
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,740
Lord Vader, I should have known.
Only you could be so bold.

31
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,060
The Imperial Senate will not sit for this,
when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...

32
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,860
Don't play games with me, Your Highness.
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.

33
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,130
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.

34
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,000
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

35
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,980
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on
a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...

36
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,530
You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor.

37
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,850
Take her away!

38
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,920
Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out,
it could generate sympathy for
the Rebellion in the senate.

39
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,730
I have traced the Rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link
to find their secret base!

40
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,600
-She'll die before she tells you anything.
-Leave that to me.

41
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,040
Send a distress signal and then inform the
senate that all aboard were killed!

42
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,740
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard
this ship! And no transmissions were made.

43
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,910
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting,
but no life forms were aboard.

44
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,050
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

45
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,730
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

46
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,150
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

47
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,240
How did I get into this mess?
I really don't know how.

48
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,940
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

49
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,180
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

50
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,290
What a desolate place this is.

51
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,900
Where are you going?
Well, I'm not going that way.

52
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,040
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.

53
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,340
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

54
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,680
Don't get technical with me.

55
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,250
What mission? What are you talking about?

56
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,090
I've had just about enough of you!

57
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,790
Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile!

58
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,960
And don't let me catch you following me
begging for help, because you won't get it.

59
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,680
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.

60
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,580
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault!

61
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,860
He tricked me into going this way,
but he'll do no better.

62
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,700
Wait, what's that?
A transport! I'm saved!

63
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,270
Over here!

64
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,970
Help! Please, help!

65
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,190
Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

66
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,000
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

67
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,330
Look, sir -- droids.

68
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,920
Wake up! Wake up!

69
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,590
We're doomed.

70
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,430
Do you think they'll melt us down?

71
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,920
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Will this never end?

72
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,140
Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator
to be sure it speaks Bocce.

73
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,640
It looks like we don't have much of a choice
but I'll remind him.

74
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,220
No, not that.

75
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,890
I suppose you are programmed for protocol.

76
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,100
Protocol. It's my primary function set...

77
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,230
-I have no need for a protocol droid.
-Of course you haven't.

78
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,800
Not in an environment such as this.

79
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
What I really need is a droid that understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

80
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,710
Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming
binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators.

81
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,550
-Do you speak Bocce?
-Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language
for me...I'm as fluent in Bocce...

82
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,420
All right shut up!
I'll take this one.

83
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,230
Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?
I want you to have both of them
cleaned up before dinner.

84
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,300
But I was going into Toshi Station
to pick up some power converters...

85
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,930
You can waste time with your friends when your
chores are done.

86
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,900
Now come on, get to it!

87
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,100
All right, come on!

88
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,770
And the red one, come on.

89
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,640
Well, come on,
Red, let's go.

90
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,000
Uncle Owen...

91
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,900
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!

92
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,200
Hey, what're you trying to push on us?

93
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,810
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in
prime condition. A real bargain.

94
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,160
Uncle Owen!
What about that one?

95
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,170
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

96
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,690
I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
He really is in first-class condition.

97
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,320
I've worked with him before.

98
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,560
Okay, let's go.

99
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,140
Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck
out for you is quite beyond my capacity!

100
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,710
Thank the maker!
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

101
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,120
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination,
I can barely move!

102
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,060
It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here!

103
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,120
Is there anything I might do to help?

104
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,830
Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the
harvest, or teleport me off this rock!

105
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,500
I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

106
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,210
Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

107
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,680
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe,
you're on the planet that it's farthest from.

108
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,180
-I see, sir.
-Uh, you can call me Luke.

109
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,180
I see, sir Luke.

110
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,250
Just Luke.

111
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,890
And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations,

112
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,530
and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.

113
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,200
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

114
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,940
With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are,
what with the Rebellion and all.

115
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,610
-You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
-That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

116
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,750
-Have you been in many battles?
-Several, I think.

117
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,850
Actually, there's not much to tell.

118
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,020
I'm not much more than an interpreter,
and not very good at telling stories.

119
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,120
Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.

120
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,260
Well, my little friend, you've got
something jammed in here real good.

121
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,360
Were you on a cruiser or...

122
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,030
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

123
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,100
What's this?

124
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,740
What is what?!? He asked you a question...
What is that?

125
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,340
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

126
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,710
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

127
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,920
Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.
Old data. Pay it no mind.

128
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,590
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

129
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,690
-I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
-Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

130
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,830
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
A person of some importance, sir -- I believe.
Our captain was attached to...

131
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,500
Is there more to this recording?

132
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,700
Behave yourself, Artoo.
You're going to get us in trouble.

133
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,740
It's all right, you can trust him.
He's our new master.

134
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,840
...You're my only hope.

135
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,050
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi,
a resident of these parts.

136
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,220
And it's a private message for him.
Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about.

137
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,320
Our last master was Captain Antilles,

138
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,490
but with what we've been through,
this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

139
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,660
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?

140
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,230
I beg your pardon, sir,
but do you know what he's talking about?

141
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,830
Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,

142
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,540
but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

143
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,140
I wonder who she is.

144
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,310
It sounds like she's in trouble.
I'd better play back the whole thing.

145
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,020
He says the restraining bolt has short
circuited his recording system.

146
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,220
He suggests that if you remove the bolt,
he might be able to play back the entire recording.

147
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,090
I guess you're too small to run
away on me if I take this off! Okay.

148
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,940
Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go?
Bring her back! Play back the entire message.

149
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,400
What message?
The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!

150
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,920
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

151
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,790
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to
have picked up a slight flutter.

152
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,560
Well, see what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

153
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,400
Just you reconsider playing that message for him.

154
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,470
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

155
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,070
No, I don't like you either.

156
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,050
-You know, I think that R2 unit we
bought might have been stolen.
-What makes you think that?

157
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,720
Well, I stumbled across a
recording while I was cleaning him.

158
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,320
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

159
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,660
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

160
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,300
-Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
-That old man's just a crazy old man.

161
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,840
Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into
Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.

162
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,470
That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.

163
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,710
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?

164
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
He won't,

165
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,750
I don't think he exists any more.
He died about the same time as your father.

166
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,120
-He knew my father?
-I told you to forget it.

167
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,290
Your only concern is to prepare the new
droids for tomorrow.

168
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,160
In the morning I want them on the south ridge
working out those condensers.

169
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,200
I think those new droids are going to work out fine.

170
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,490
I was also thinking about our agreement about
my staying on another season.

171
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,800
And if these new droids do work out, I want to
transmit my application to the Academy this year.

172
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,750
-You mean the next semester before harvest?
-Sure, there're more than enough droids.

173
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,350
Harvest is when I need you the most.
Only one more season.

174
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,630
This year we'll make enough on the harvest
so I'll be able to hire some more hands.

175
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,200
And then you can go to the Academy next year.

176
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,330
-You must understand I need you here, Luke.
-But it's a whole 'nother year.

177
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,290
-Look, it's only one more season.
-Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

178
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,560
-Where are you going?
-It looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to finish cleaning those droids.

179
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,840
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

180
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,550
-It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.

181
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,650
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

182
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,360
That's what I'm afraid of.

183
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,870
What are you doing hiding there?

184
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,010
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

185
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,110
I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.

186
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,410
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

187
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,870
These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand their logic at times.

188
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,350
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!

189
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?

190
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,890
It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait until morning.

191
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,950
-Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
-All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.

192
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,080
Boy, am I gonna get it.

193
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,690
-You know that little droid is going
to cause me a lot of trouble.
-Oh, he excels at that, sir.

194
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,250
Have you seen Luke this morning?

195
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,820
He said he had some things to do
before he started today, so he left early.

196
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,520
-Did he take those two new droids with him?
-I think so.

197
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,660
Well, he'd better have those units in the south range
repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!

198
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,580
There's something dead ahead on the scanner.

199
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,310
It looks like our R2-Unit...hit the accelerator.

200
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,390
Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?

201
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,560
Master Luke here is your rightful owner.

202
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,630
We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish...

203
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,870
And don't talk to me about your mission, either.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a
million pieces right here.

204
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,940
No, it's alright.

205
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,110
What's wrong with him now?

206
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,740
He says there are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

207
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,350
Sandpeople! Or worst!

208
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,450
Come on, let's have a look. Come on.

209
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,890
There are two Banthas down there but
I don't see any...wait a second,

210
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,340
they're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.

211
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,970
Hello there!

212
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,530
Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.

213
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,880
Don't worry, he'll be all right.

214
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,690
Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.

215
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,360
You're fortunate you're still in one piece.

216
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,600
Ben? Ben Kenobi!

217
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,670
Boy, am I glad to see you!

218
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,640
The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.

219
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,040
Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?

220
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,610
Oh, this little droid!

221
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,920
I think he's searching for his former master...
I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...

222
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,620
He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

223
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,690
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

224
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,050
Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...

225
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,740
a long time.

226
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,200
I think my uncle knew him.
He said he was dead.

227
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,900
Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet.

228
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,750
-Do you know him?
-Well of course, of course I know him. He's me!

229
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,860
I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh,
before you were born.

230
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,700
Then the droid does belong to you.

231
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,270
Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.

232
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,940
Very interesting...

233
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,610
I think we better get indoors.

234
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:37,280
The Sandpeople are easily startled
but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.

235
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,900
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...

236
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,420
Can you stand? We've got to get out of
here before the Sandpeople return.

237
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,440
I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.

238
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,160
There's no sense in you risking yourself on my
account. I'm done for.

239
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,790
-No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
-Quickly, son...they're on the move.

240
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,920
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

241
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,560
That's what your uncle told you.

242
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,530
Thought he should have stayed here and
not gotten involved.

243
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,860
You fought in the Clone Wars?

244
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,470
Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.

245
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,240
-I wish I'd known him.
-He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy,

246
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,630
and a cunning warrior.

247
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,380
I understand you've become quite
a good pilot yourself.

248
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,350
And he was a good friend.

249
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,170
Which reminds me...
I have something here for you.

250
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,810
Your father wanted you to have
this when you were old enough,

251
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,160
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

252
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,120
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan

253
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,940
on some damned-fool idealistic
crusade like your father did.

254
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,970
-Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for awhile.
-Sure, go ahead.

255
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
What is it?

256
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,920
Your father's lightsaber.
his is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.

257
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,940
Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.

258
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,590
An elegant weapon

259
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,030
for a more civilized age.

260
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,310
For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights

261
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,820
were the guardians of peace and
justice in the Old Republic.

262
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,290
Before the dark times, before the Empire.

263
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,580
How did my father die?

264
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,920
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,

265
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,940
who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil,

266
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,960
helped the Empire hunt down and
destroy the Jedi Knights.

267
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,260
He betrayed and murdered your father.

268
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,930
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

269
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,440
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.

270
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,940
The Force?

271
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,480
Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

272
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,110
It's an energy
field created by all living things.

273
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,280
It surrounds us and penetrates us.
It binds the galaxy together.

274
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,040
Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are,
my little friend.

275
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,560
And where you come from.

276
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,680
-I saw part of the message he was...
-I seem to have found it.

277
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,100
General Kenobi, years ago you served my
father in the Clone Wars.

278
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,740
Now he begs you to help him in his
struggle against the Empire.

279
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,130
I regret that I am unable to present my father's
request to you in person,

280
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,110
but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid
my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

281
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,640
I have placed information vital to the survival of the
Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2-unit.

282
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,340
My father will know how to retrieve it.

283
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,440
You must see this droid safely delivered
to him on Alderaan.

284
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,060
This is our most desperate hour.

285
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,770
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

286
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,550
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

287
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:43,560
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

288
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,060
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help.

289
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,660
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

290
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,000
I can't get involved! I've got work to do!

291
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,180
It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it!
But there's nothing I can do about it right now.

292
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,930
-It's such a long way from here.
-That's your uncle talking.

293
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,790
Oh, God, my uncle.
How am I ever going to explain this?

294
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,990
Learn about the Force, Luke.

295
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,650
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

296
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,950
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley
or wherever you're going.

297
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,550
You must do what you feel is right, of course.

298
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,080
Until this battle station is fully operational
we are vulnerable.

299
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,690
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.

300
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:51,690
Dangerous to your Starfleet, Commander,
not to this battle station!

301
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,130
The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the
Imperial Senate as long as....

302
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,730
The Imperial Senate will no longer be
of any concern to us.

303
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,150
I've just received word that the Emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

304
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,320
The last remnants of the Old Republic
have been swept away.

305
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,360
That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain
control without the bureaucracy?

306
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,780
The regional governors now have direct control
over their territories.

307
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,620
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

308
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,290
-Fear of this battle station.
-And what of the Rebellion?

309
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,900
If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical
readout of this station, it is possible,

310
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,730
however unlikely, that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

311
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,240
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

312
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,120
Any attack made by the Rebels against this station
would be a useless gesture,

313
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,990
no matter what technical data they've obtained.

314
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,010
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.

315
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,280
I suggest we use it!

316
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,890
Don't be too proud of this technological
terror you've constructed.

317
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:58,190
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next
to the power of the Force.

318
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,300
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's
ways, Lord Vader.

319
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,870
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion

320
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,970
has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes,

321
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,640
or given you clairvoyance enough to find the
Rebel's hidden fort...

322
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,130
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

323
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,440
Enough of this! Vader, release him!

324
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,290
As you wish.

325
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,430
This bickering is pointless.

326
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,380
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the Rebel fortress

327
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,730
by the time this station is operational.

328
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,340
We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

329
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,600
It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here
are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

330
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,420
They didn't. But we are meant to think they did.

331
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,910
These tracks are
side by side.

332
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,980
Sandpeople always ride single file to hide
their numbers.

333
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,930
These are the same Jawas that sold us
Artoo and Threepio.

334
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,100
And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.

335
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,270
Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.

336
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,970
Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?

337
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,000
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned
who they sold them to.
And that would lead them...

338
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,350
- Home!
 - Wait, Luke!

339
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,460
It's too dangerous.

340
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,700
Uncle Owen!

341
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,780
Aunt Beru!

342
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,140
And, now Your Highness,

343
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,810
we will discuss the location of your
hidden Rebel base.

344
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,870
There's nothing you could have done, Luke,
had you been there.

345
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,790
You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would
be in the hands of the Empire.

346
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,530
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing here for me now.

347
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,730
I want to learn the ways of the Force and
become a Jedi like my father.

348
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,420
Mos Eisley Spaceport.

349
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,090
You will never find a more wretched hive of
scum and villainy.

350
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,770
We must be cautious.

351
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,210
-How long have you had these droids?
-About three or four seasons.

352
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
They're for sale if you want them.

353
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,020
-Let me see your identification.
-You don't need to see his identification.

354
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,120
We don't need to see his identification.

355
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,730
These are not the droids your looking for.

356
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,360
These are not the droids we're looking for.

357
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,960
He can go about his business.

358
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,070
-You can go about your business.
-Move along.

359
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,200
Move along. Move along.

360
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,220
I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.

361
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,260
I can't understand how we got by those troopers.
I thought we were dead.

362
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,890
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

363
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,630
Do you really think we're going to find a pilot
here that'll take us to Alderaan?

364
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,050
Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found
here. Only watch your step.

365
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,950
This place can be a little rough.

366
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,680
I'm ready for anything.

367
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,560
Come along, Artoo.

368
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:51,080
-We don't serve their kind here!
-What?
-Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.

369
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,400
Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

370
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,830
I heartily agree with you sir.

371
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,130
-He doesn't like you.
-I'm sorry.

372
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,270
I don't like you either

373
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,190
Don't insult us. You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.

374
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,330
I have the death sentence in twelve systems.

375
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,180
-I'll be careful than.
-You'll be dead.

376
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,880
This little one isn't worth the effort.

377
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,980
Come let me buy you something...

378
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm alright.

379
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,750
Chewbacca here is first-mate on a ship
that might suit our needs.

380
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,560
I don't like the look of this.

381
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,240
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.

382
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,910
Chewie here tells me you're looking for
passage to the Alderaan system.

383
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,480
Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

384
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,050
Fast ship? You've never heard of the
Millennium Falcon?

385
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:18,290
-Should I have?
-It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than
twelve parsecs!

386
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,930
I've outrun Imperial starships,

387
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,600
not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.

388
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,810
She's fast enough for you, old man.

389
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,940
-What's the cargo?
-Only passengers.

390
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,580
Myself, the boy, two droids,

391
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,680
and no questions asked.

392
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,880
What is it? Some kind of local trouble?

393
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:48,520
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial
entanglements.

394
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,690
Well, that's the trick, isn't it?

395
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,260
And it's going to cost you something extra.

396
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,970
Ten thousand, all in advance.

397
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Ten thousand?

398
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,170
We could almost buy our own ship for that!

399
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,740
But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

400
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,210
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself!
We don't have to sit here and listen...

401
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,720
We can pay you two thousand now,
plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

402
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,020
Seventeen, huh!

403
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,530
Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.

404
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,700
-We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking bay Ninety-four.
-Ninety-four.

405
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,940
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest
in your handiwork.

406
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,540
All right, we'll check it out.

407
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,690
Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be
desperate.

408
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,290
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship and get her ready.

409
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,530
-You'll have to sell your speeder.
-That's okay. I'm never coming back to this
planet again.

410
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,200
Going somewhere, Solo?

411
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,840
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to
see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

412
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,510
It's too late. You should have paid him when
you had the chance.

413
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,680
Jabba's put a price on your head,

414
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,600
so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

415
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,990
- I'm lucky I found you first.
-Yeah, but this time I got the money.

416
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,630
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

417
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,230
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

418
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,800
Jabba's through with you.

419
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:42,540
He has no time for smugglers who drop heir
shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

420
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:46,210
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

421
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,880
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

422
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,720
-Over my dead body.
-That's the idea. I've been looking forward to
killing you for a long time.

423
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,220
Yes, I'll bet you have.

424
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,900
Sorry about the mess.

425
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,850
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.

426
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,020
It will be some time before we can extract any
information from her.

427
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,160
The final check-out is complete.
All systems are operational.

428
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,220
What course shall we set?

429
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,400
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative
form of persuasion.

430
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,570
-What do you mean?
-I think it is time we demonstrate the full power
of this station.

431
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,670
-Set your course for Alderaan.
-With pleasure.

432
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,340
Lock the door, Artoo.

433
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,510
All right, check that side of the street.

434
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,220
It's locked. Move on to the next door.

435
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:13,090
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke
than stay here with you.

436
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,300
I don't know what all the trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault..

437
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,370
You watch your language!

438
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,540
I'll take it.

439
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,680
Since the XP-38 came out,
they're just not in demand.

440
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,280
It will be enough.

441
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,050
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

442
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,820
What a piece of junk.

443
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,420
She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.

444
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,590
She may not look like much, but she's got it where
it counts, kid.

445
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,190
I've added some special modifications myself.

446
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,940
We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll
get out of here.

447
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:34,100
Hello, sir.

448
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,150
All right, men. Load your weapons!

449
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,490
Stop that ship! Blast 'em!

450
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,260
Chewie, get us out of here!

451
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,500
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

452
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,110
It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.

453
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,940
Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while
I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.

454
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,910
Stay sharp! There are two more coming in;
they're going to try to cut us off.

455
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,600
-Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said
this thing was fast.
-Watch your mouth, kid

456
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,570
We'll be safe enough once we make the
jump to hyperspace.

457
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,400
Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!

458
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,630
-Here's where the fun begins!
-How long before you can make the jump
to light speed?

459
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,750
-It'll take a few moments to get the
coordinates from the navi-computer.
-Are you kidding?

460
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:10,100
Traveling through hyperspace isn't like
dusting crops, boy!

461
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,640
Without precise calculations we could fly
right through a star

462
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,310
or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end
your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

463
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:21,260
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm
going to make the jump to light speed.

464
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,470
We've entered the Alderaan system.

465
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:50,140
Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to
find you holding Vader's leash.

466
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,310
I recognized your foul stench when I
was brought on board.

467
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,780
Charming to the last.

468
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,150
You don't know how hard I found it
signing the order to terminate your life!

469
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,260
I surprised you had the courage to take the
responsibility yourself!

470
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:10,250
Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you
to be my guest at a ceremony

471
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,030
that will make this battle station operational.

472
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,730
No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.

473
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,440
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star
systems will slip through your fingers.

474
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,540
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.

475
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,380
In a way, you have determined the choice of the
planet that'll be destroyed first.

476
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,420
Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location
of the Rebel base,

477
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,810
I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of

478
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,130
Alderaan.

479
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,080
No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons.
You can't possibly...

480
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,930
You would prefer another target? A military target?
Then name the system!

481
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,240
I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time.

482
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,840
Where is the Rebel base?

483
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,010
Dantooine.

484
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,580
They're on Dantooine.

485
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,790
There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable.

486
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,290
Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.

487
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,620
-What?
-You're far too trusting.

488
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,560
Dantooine is too remote to make an
effective demonstration.

489
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,770
But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel
friends soon enough.

490
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,940
Commence primary ignition.

491
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,930
Are you all right? What's wrong?

492
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,600
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

493
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,240
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and
were suddenly silenced.

494
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,410
I fear something terrible has happened.

495
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,110
You'd better get on with your exercises.

496
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,350
Well, you can forget your troubles with those
Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.

497
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,590
Don't everyone thank me at once.

498
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,230
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about oh-two-hundred hours.

499
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,670
Now be careful, Artoo.

500
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,330
He made a fair move. Screaming about it
won't help you.

501
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,570
-Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
-But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.

502
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,460
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of
their socket when they lose.

503
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,600
Wookiees are known to do that.

504
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,230
I see your point, sir.

505
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:04,870
I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.
Let the Wookiee win.

506
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,720
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing
through him.

507
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:33,000
-You mean it controls your actions?
-Partially. But it also obeys your commands.

508
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,340
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

509
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,660
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

510
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,790
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy
to the other.

511
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,680
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,

512
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:54,890
but I've never seen anything to make me believe
there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.

513
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,520
There's no mystical energy field that controls my
destiny.

514
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,190
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

515
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,760
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

516
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,930
This time, let go your conscious self

517
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,040
and act on instinct.

518
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,730
With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
How am I supposed to fight?

519
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,080
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

520
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,860
Stretch out with your feelings.

521
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,470
You see, you can do it.

522
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:52,640
-I call it luck.
-In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.

523
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:58,380
Look, going good against remotes is one thing.
Going good against the living? That's something else.

524
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,020
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

525
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,910
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

526
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,900
That's good. You have taken your first
step into a larger world.

527
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,340
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

528
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,180
They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.

529
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,150
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

530
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,220
She lied! She lied to us!

531
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,890
I told you she would never consciously
betray the Rebellion.

532
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,560
Terminate her...immediately!

533
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,260
Stand by, Chewie, here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

534
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,400
What the...?

535
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,870
Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor
shower. Some kind of asteroid collision.

536
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,060
-It's not on any of the charts.
-What's going on?

537
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,850
Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan!

538
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,050
-What do you mean? Where is it?
-Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.

539
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,650
-What? How?
-Destroyed...by the Empire!

540
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:12,320
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
It'd take a thousand ships with more
fire power than I've...

541
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:16,780
-There's another ship coming in.
-Maybe they know what happened.

542
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,600
It's an Imperial fighter.

543
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,730
-It followed us!
-No. It's a short range fighter.

544
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,370
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

545
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,960
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in big trouble.

546
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:35,500
-Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.
-It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.

547
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,750
Not for long...

548
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,550
A fighter that size couldn't get this
deep into space on its own.

549
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,440
It must have gotten lost, been part
of a convoy or something.

550
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,790
Well, he ain't going to be around long enough
to tell anyone about us.

551
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,980
-Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.
-I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in
range.

552
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,670
That's no moon!

553
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,340
-It's a space station.
-It's too big to be a space station.

554
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,650
-I have a very bad feeling about this.
-Turn the ship around.

555
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:15,350
Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse!
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

556
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,630
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

557
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,830
-Why are we still moving towards it?
-We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!

558
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,120
-But there's gotta be something you can do!
-There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.

559
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,110
I'm going to have to shut down.
But they're not going to get me without a fight!

560
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,950
You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

561
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,950
To you stations! Come with me.

562
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,500
We've captured a freighter entering the remains of
the Alderaan system.

563
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,100
It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its
way out of Mos Eisley.

564
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,310
They must be trying to return the stolen
plans to the princess.

565
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,140
She may yet be of some use to us.

566
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,750
Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.

567
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,560
There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the
crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.

568
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:09,570
It must be a decoy, sir. Several
of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

569
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,500
-Did you find any droids?
-No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also
have jettisoned.

570
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:17,140
Send a scanning crew on board.
I want every part of this ship checked.

571
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:22,450
I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since...

572
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,650
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
I want every part of this ship checked!

573
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,630
-Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
-I use them for smuggling.

574
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,130
I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in
them. This is ridiculous.

575
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,780
-Even if I could take off, I'd never get past
the tractor beam.
-Leave that to me!

576
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,790
Leave that to me!

577
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,790
Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!

578
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,820
Who's the more foolish...
the fool or the fool who follows him?

579
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:19,170
The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything,
report it immediately.

580
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,810
All right, let's go.

581
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,890
Hey down there,

582
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,360
could you give us a hand with this?

583
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,470
TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post?

584
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,140
TX-four-one-two, do you copy?

585
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:11,420
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

586
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:33,780
You know, between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

587
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,800
Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all
this sneaking around.

588
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,870
-We found the computer outlet, sir.
-Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire
Imperial computer network.

589
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,070
He says he's found the main computer to power the
tractor beam that's holding the ship here.

590
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:00,140
He'll try to make the precise location appear
on the monitor.

591
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,530
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

592
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,420
Whatever you say. I've done more that I
bargained for on this trip already.

593
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:21,040
-I want to go with you.
-Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.

594
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:25,730
They must be delivered safely or other star
systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.

595
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,400
Your destiny lies along a different path than mine.

596
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,620
The Force will be with you...always!

597
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,790
Boy you said it, Chewie.

598
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:53,710
-Where did you dig up that old fossil?
-Ben is a great man.

599
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,580
-Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
-I didn't hear you give any ideas...

600
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:01,130
-Well, anything would be better than just hanging
around waiting for him to pick us up...
-Who do you think...

601
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:05,240
-What is it?
-I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

602
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,340
He says "I found her", and
keeps repeating, "She's here."

603
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:12,260
-Well, who...who has he found?
-Princess Leia.

604
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,860
- The princess? She's here?
- Princess?

605
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,330
Where is she?

606
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:17,720
What's going on?

607
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:26,720
Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three.

608
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,360
I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.

609
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,780
- Oh, no! We've got to do something.
- What are you talking about?

610
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,140
The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message..
We've got to help her.

611
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,780
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right here.

612
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:47,090
But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way
back into the detention block?

613
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,260
-I'm not going anywhere.
-They're going to execute her.

614
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,620
Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to
just wait here to be captured. Now all you want
to do is stay.

615
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,500
Marching into the detention area is not what I
had in mind.

616
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,360
-But they're going to kill her!
-Better her than me...

617
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,270
She's rich.

618
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,900
Rich?

619
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:17,610
Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

620
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:20,740
-What?
-Well more wealth that you can imagine.

621
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,850
-I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
-You'll get it!

622
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,420
-You will...

623
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,800
All right, kid.
But you'd better be right about this.

624
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:31,150
-All Right
-What's your plan?

625
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,290
Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?

626
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,330
Okay.

627
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,960
Now, I'm going to put these on you.

628
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,870
Okay. Han, you put these on.

629
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,310
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

630
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,870
Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...

631
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,540
but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're
discovered here?

632
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,680
-Lock the door!
-And hope they don't have blasters.

633
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,250
That isn't very reassuring.

634
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,400
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

635
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,740
-This is not going to work.
-Why didn't you say so before?

636
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:29,840
I did say so before!

637
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,520
Where are you taking this...thing?

638
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:50,130
Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.

639
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,830
I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.

640
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,670
He's going to pull us all apart.

641
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,230
Watch out!

642
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,900
We've got to find out which cell this princess of
yours is in.

643
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:46,380
Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven.
You go get her. I'll hold them here.

644
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,690
Everything is under control. Situation normal.

645
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:57,330
-What happened?
-Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction.

646
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:02,750
But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.
We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you.

647
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,600
-How are you?
-We're sending a squad up.

648
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,090
Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now.

649
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:14,480
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak...very dangerous.

650
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:16,610
Who is this? What's your operating number?

651
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,350
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke! We're going to have company!

652
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,140
Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?

653
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,570
What? Oh...the uniform.

654
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,210
I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

655
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,810
-You're who?
-I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

656
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:51,010
-Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
-Come on!

657
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,650
-He is here...
-Obi-Wan Kenobi!

658
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,320
-What makes you think so?
-A tremor in the Force.

659
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:04,490
The last time I felt it was in the presence
of my old master.

660
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,320
-Surely he must be dead by now.
-Don't underestimate the Force.

661
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,370
The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of
the universe.

662
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,010
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.

663
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:22,710
Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three.

664
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,070
The princess! Put all sections on alert!

665
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,990
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

666
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,870
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.

667
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,730
Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

668
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,770
Get behind me! Get behind me!

669
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:07,770
-Can't get out that way.
-Looks like you managed to cut off our only
escape route.

670
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,130
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.

671
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:13,630
See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

672
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,360
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off! 

673
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,360
What was that? I didn't copy!

674
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:26,240
I said, all systems have been alerted to
your presence, sir.

675
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:31,110
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out;
all other information on your level is restricted.

676
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,550
Open up in there!

677
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,150
Oh, no!

678
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,720
There isn't any other way out.

679
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,980
I can't hold them off forever! Now what?

680
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,780
This is some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

681
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:52,940
-He's the brains, sweetheart.
-Well, I didn't...

682
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,770
-What the hell are you doing?
-Somebody has to save our skins.

683
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,210
Into the garbage chute, wise guy.

684
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,810
Get in there you big furry oaf!

685
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,410
I don't care what you smell!

686
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,880
Get in there and don't worry about it.

687
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,970
Wonderful girl!

688
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,440
Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.

689
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,970
Get in there!

690
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,460
Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.

691
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:50,030
What an incredible smell you've discovered!

692
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,160
Let's get out of here! Get away from there...

693
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,370
No! wait!

694
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:06,040
Will you forget it? I already tried it.
It's magnetically sealed!

695
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,310
Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.

696
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:12,750
Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything
under control until you led us down here.

697
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,770
You know, it's not going to take them long to figure
out what happened to us.

698
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,890
It could be worst...

699
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:26,000
-It's worst. -There's something alive in here!
-That's your imagination.

700
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,630
Something just moves past my leg!

701
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,550
Look! Did you see that?

702
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,840
What?

703
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:57,580
Luke! Luke! Luke!

704
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,320
Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

705
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:14,740
-Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.
-Where?

706
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,550
Anywhere! Oh!!

707
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,860
Luke! Luke!

708
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:50,950
Grab him!

709
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:55,450
-What happened?
-I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...

710
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,890
I've got a very bad feeling about this.

711
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,740
-The walls are moving!
-Don't just stand there.
Try to brace it with something.

712
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,650
!!!!!!!

713
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:38,530
Wait a minute!

714
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:43,250
Threepio! Come in Threepio!

715
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,350
Threepio! Where could he be?

716
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,480
Take over! See to him!

717
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,950
Look there!

718
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,150
They're madmen! They're heading for the prison
level. If you hurry, you might catch them.

719
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,720
Follow me!

720
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,460
You stand guard.

721
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,730
Come on!

722
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,500
Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits
of my counterpart here.

723
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,320
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him
down to maintenance.

724
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:34,920
All right.

725
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:51,270
Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

726
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:54,330
-Get to the top!
-I can't

727
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,740
Where could he be? Threepio!

728
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,260
Threepio, will you come in?

729
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,450
They aren't here! Something must have
happened to them.

730
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,050
See if they've been captured. Hurry!

731
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,850
One thing's for sure. We're all going to
be a lot thinner!

732
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,560
-Get on top of it!
-I'm trying!

733
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:25,400
Thank goodness, they haven't found them!
Where could they be?

734
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,570
Use the comlink?

735
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:32,070
Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!

736
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,880
-Are you there, sir?
-Threepio!

737
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,020
-We've had some problems...
-Will you shut up and listen to me?

738
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,740
Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention
level, will you?

739
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:48,660
Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on
the detention level.

740
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,930
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention
level.

741
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,100
No. Shut them all down!
Hurry!

742
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:14,320
Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!

743
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,400
Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master!

744
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,370
Threepio, we're all right!
We're all right. You did great.

745
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,260
Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on
unit number... where are we?

746
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,430
32-63-827!

747
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:19,170
If we can just avoid any more female advice, we
ought to be able to get out of here.

748
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,450
Well, let's get moving!

749
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:23,620
Where are you going?

750
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:26,190
No, wait. They'll hear!

751
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,760
Come here, you big coward!

752
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:35,060
Listen. I don't know who you are,
or where you came from,

753
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,170
but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

754
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:41,520
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight!

755
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:44,410
I take orders from one person! Me!

756
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:47,040
It's a wonder you're still alive.

757
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,110
Will somebody get this big walking carpet out
of my way?

758
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:53,250
No reward is worth this.

759
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,730
Give me regular reports.

760
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:11,500
-Do you know what's going on?
-Maybe it's another drill.

761
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:24,010
What was that?

762
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,770
Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

763
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:35,930
-There she is.
-See-Threepio, do you copy?

764
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:39,060
-Are you safe?
-For the moment.

765
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,800
Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.

766
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,850
We're right above you. Stand by.

767
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:48,970
-You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.
-Nice! Come on!

768
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,960
It's them! Blast them!

769
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:59,420
-Get back to the ship!
-Where are you going? Come back!

770
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,490
-He certainly has courage.
-What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?

771
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,680
I think we took a wrong turn.

772
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:37,350
There's no lock!

773
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:43,630
-That oughta hold it for a while.
-Quick, we've got to get across.

774
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:46,730
-Find the control that extends the bridge.
-Oh, I think I just blasted it.

775
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:48,580
They're coming through!

776
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,200
Here, hold this.

777
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:30,760
Here they come!

778
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,940
For luck!

779
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,110
Where could they be?

780
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,910
Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!

781
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:47,580
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again, at last.

782
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,690
The circle is now complete.

783
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:55,360
When I left you, I was but the learner;
now I am the master.

784
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:57,990
Only a master of evil, Darth.

785
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,950
Your powers are weak, old man.

786
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,270
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down,

787
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,390
I shall become more
powerful than you can possibly imagine.

788
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,000
You should not have come back.

789
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:04,630
Didn't we just leave this party?

790
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,620
-What kept you?
-We ran into some old friends.

791
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:11,930
-Is the ship all right?
-Seems okay, if we can get to it.

792
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,500
Just hope the old man got the tractor
beam out of commission.

793
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,250
Look!

794
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:35,390
Come on, Artoo, we're going!

795
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,460
Now's our chance! Go!

796
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,030
Ben!

797
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:00,020
No!

798
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,260
-Come on!
-Come on!

799
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:15,130
-Luke, its too late!
-Blast the door! Kid!

800
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,710
Run, Luke! Run!

801
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:34,000
I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if
commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.

802
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,120
We're coming up on the sentry ships.

803
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:11,440
Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while
I charge up the main guns!

804
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,570
I can't believe he's gone.

805
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,840
-There wasn't anything you could have done.
-Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!

806
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,830
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

807
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,710
Here they come!

808
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,510
They're coming in too fast!

809
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,370
-We've lost lateral controls.
-Don't worry, she'll hold together.

810
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:37,710
You hear me, baby? Hold together!

811
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,380
Got him! I got him!

812
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:03,750
Great kid! Don't get cocky.

813
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,190
There are still two more of them out there!

814
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:43,470
-That's it! We did it!
-We did it!

815
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:47,140
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault.

816
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,890
-Are they away?
-They have just made the jump into hyperspace.

817
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,130
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?

818
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:08,350
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

819
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:10,900
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

820
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:14,350
You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

821
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:18,510
That doesn't sound too hard.
Besides, they let us go.

822
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:21,510
It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.

823
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:26,650
-Easy...you call that easy? -Their tracking us!
-Not this ship, sister.

824
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:29,120
At least the information in Artoo is still intact.

825
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:31,890
What's so important? What's he carrying?

826
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:34,460
The technical readouts of that battle station.

827
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,210
I only hope that when the data is analyzed,
a weakness can be found.

828
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:41,830
-It's not over yet!
-It is for me, sister!

829
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,580
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

830
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,870
I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!

831
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:52,360
You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love,

832
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:54,710
then that's what you'll receive!

833
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:01,030
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything

834
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,350
...or anyone.

835
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:04,890
I care!

836
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:17,150
-So...what do you think of her, Han?
-I'm trying not to, kid!

837
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,100
Good...

838
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:25,440
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

839
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,960
Do you think a princess and a guy like me...

840
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:32,210
No!

841
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,280
You're safe! When we heard about Alderaan.
We had feared the worst.

842
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:24,580
We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander.

843
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:28,450
You must use the information in this R2 unit
to plan the attack. It is our only hope.

844
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:53,050
-Yes.
-We are approaching the planet Yavin.

845
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,610
The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.

846
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:58,050
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

847
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,160
The battle station is heavily shielded

848
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:12,210
and carries a firepower greater than half the
star fleet.

849
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:16,690
It's defenses are designed around a
direct large-scale assault.

850
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:22,290
A small one-man fighter should be able to
penetrate the outer defense.

851
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:27,910
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub
fighters going to be against that?

852
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:32,580
Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man
fighter to be any threat,

853
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:34,900
or they'd have a tighter defense.

854
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,860
An analysis of the plans provided
by Princess Leia has demonstrated

855
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:42,680
a weakness in the battle station.

856
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:45,280
The approach will not be easy.

857
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:48,370
You are required to maneuver straight
down this trench

858
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,720
and skim the surface to this point.

859
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,360
The target area is only two meters wide.

860
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:58,530
It's a small thermal exhaust port,
right below the main port.

861
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:02,650
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.

862
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:07,420
A precise hit will start a chain reaction which
should destroy the station.

863
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:10,860
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.

864
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:14,640
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

865
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:18,350
-That's impossible, even for a computer.
-It's not impossible.

866
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:22,520
I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen
back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.

867
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:26,620
Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

868
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,530
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

869
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,500
The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in
thirty minutes.

870
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,910
This will be a day long remembered.

871
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:46,590
It has seen the end of Kenobi

872
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:49,540
and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

873
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,000
All flight trooper, man your stations.

874
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:00,620
All flight troops, man your stations.

875
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,880
So...you got your reward and you're just
leaving then?

876
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:08,480
That's right, yeah!

877
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,650
I got some old debts
I've got to pay off with this stuff.

878
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:15,820
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do you?

879
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:20,560
Why don't you come with us? You're pretty
good in a fight. I could use you.

880
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:24,980
Come on! Why don't you take a look around?
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

881
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:29,250
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

882
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:31,870
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?

883
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:35,640
Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my
idea of courage.

884
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:37,740
It's more like suicide.

885
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:44,050
All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han.
I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?

886
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,840
Hey, Luke...

887
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:51,540
may the Force be with you!

888
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:02,020
What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

889
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:19,730
-What's wrong?
-Oh, it's Han!

890
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:22,340
I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.

891
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,840
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

892
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,510
I only wish Ben were here.

893
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,960
This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.
Do you want a new one?

894
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:56,630
Not on your life! That little droid and I have
been through a lot together.

895
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:57,360
You okay, Artoo?

896
01:40:58,830 --> 01:40:59,750
Good.

897
01:41:05,070 --> 01:41:07,370
Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.

898
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,110
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?

899
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:02,530
Luke, the Force will be with you.

900
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:18,150
Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching.

901
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,120
Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.

902
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:36,000
All wings report in.

903
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,670
-Red Ten standing by.
-Red Seven standing by.

904
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,930
-Red Three standing by.
-Red Six standing by.

905
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:43,540
-Red Nine standing by.
-Red Two standing by.

906
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:46,840
-Red Eleven standing by.
-Red Five standing by.

907
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,410
Lock S-foils in attack position.

908
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,520
-We're passing through their magnetic field.
-Hold tight!

909
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:59,190
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front!

910
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,510
-Look at the size of that thing!
-Cut the chatter, Red Two.

911
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,830
Accelerate to attack speed.

912
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:13,270
-This is it, boys!
-Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

913
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:15,740
-I copy, Gold Leader.

914
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,540
We're starting for the target shaft now.
We're in position.

915
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,640
I'm going to cut across the axis and
try and draw their fire.

916
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:37,910
Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.
I see it. Stay low.

917
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,170
This is Red Five.
I'm going in!

918
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:52,890
Luke, pull up!

919
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,580
-Are you all right?
-I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

920
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:06,250
We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're
so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!

921
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:09,920
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.

922
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:17,730
-Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the
right side of that deflection tower.
-I'm on it.

923
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:21,940
-I'm going in, cover me Parkins!
-I'm right with you, Red 3!

924
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,440
I've go a problem here...

925
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:33,250
-Pull up
-No, I'm alright...

926
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,950
Rebel base will be in range in seven minutes.

927
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:47,900
Luke, trust your feelings!

928
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:58,910
Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group
of signals.

929
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:02,990
-Enemy fighters coming your way.
-My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

930
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,410
-Keep up your visual scanning.
-Here the come.

931
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:10,350
Watch it, you've got one on your tail.

932
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:16,520
I'm hit!

933
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:20,190
-You've picked one up...watch it!
-I can't see it!

934
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,550
He's on me tight, I can't shake him.

935
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,070
I'll be right there.

936
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:43,650
Several fighters have broken off from the main group.
Come with me!

937
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,990
Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!

938
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:01,300
I'm hit, but not bad.
Artoo, see what you can do with it.

939
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,540
Red Six can you see Red Five?

940
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:09,230
There's a heavy fire zone on this side.
Red Five, where are you?

941
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,710
I can't shake him!

942
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:15,880
I'm on him, Luke!

943
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:20,820
Biggs, where are you?

944
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,060
-Thanks, Wedge.
-Good shooting, Wedge!

945
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:33,970
Red Leader this is Gold Leader.
We're starting out attack run.

946
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:38,110
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.

947
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:42,680
Stay in attack formation!

948
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:45,680
The exhaust post is...

949
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:57,560
Switch power to front deflector screens.

950
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,620
How many guns do you think, Gold Five.

951
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:07,270
I'd say about twenty guns.
Some on the surface, some on the towers.

952
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:11,070
Death Star will be in range in five minutes.

953
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:15,810
Switching to targeting computer.

954
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,950
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

955
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,620
The guns...they've stopped!

956
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:29,820
Stabilize your read deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

957
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,960
They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.

958
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:37,560
-I'll take them myself! Cover me!
-Yes, sir.

959
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,350
-I can't maneuver!
-We're too close.

960
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,120
-We're too close.
-Stay on target!

961
01:47:58,990 --> 01:47:59,990
Loosen up!

962
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:05,530
Gold Five to Red Leader...
Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.

963
01:48:05,930 --> 01:48:08,360
-I copy, Gold Five.
-They came from behind....

964
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:17,000
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

965
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,370
-Should I have your ship standing by?
-Evacuate?

966
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:23,380
In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances!

967
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:26,980
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.

968
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:29,880
Red Group, this is Red Leader.

969
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,650
Rendezvous at mark six point one.

970
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:34,550
-This is Red Two. Flying toward you.
-Red Three, standing by.

971
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,390
Red Leader, this is Base One.

972
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:39,690
Keep half your group out of range for the next run.

973
01:48:40,190 --> 01:48:42,200
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.

974
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:45,230
Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.

975
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:55,940
This is it!

976
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:02,020
We should be able to see it by now.

977
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:06,250
Keep your eyes open for those fighters!

978
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:10,120
There's too much interference!
Red Five, can you see them from where you are?

979
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,390
No sign of any...wait!
Coming in point three five.

980
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:15,200
I see them.
I'm in range.

981
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,330
Target's coming up!

982
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:23,700
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

983
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:25,770
Close up formation.

984
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:28,980
Almost there!

985
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,990
-You'd better let her loose.

986
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,260
I can't hold them!

987
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:54,000
It's away!

988
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:01,710
-It's a hit!
-Negative. Negative! It didn't go in.

989
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,010
It just impacted on the surface.

990
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:15,290
Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to
point oh-five; we'll cover for you.

991
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:17,990
Stay there I just lost my starboard engine.

992
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,330
Get set to make your attack run.

993
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:37,180
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

994
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:40,550
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

995
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:43,180
-We're going in full throttle.
-Right with you, boss.

996
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,620
Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?

997
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:49,570
It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.

998
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,030
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

999
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:01,470
My scope shows the tower, but
I can't see the exhaust port!

1000
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:03,700
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1001
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:10,080
-Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle!
-What about the tower?

1002
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:12,780
You worry about those fighters!
I'll worry about the tower!

1003
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:22,990
Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!
See if you can't lock it down!

1004
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,760
Coming in point three.

1005
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,190
I'm hit! I can't stay with you.

1006
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:47,550
-Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more
good back there!
-Sorry!

1007
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:50,580
Let him go! Stay on the leader!

1008
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:55,960
Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time.
I can't hold them!

1009
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:01,490
Artoo, try and increase the power!

1010
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:09,370
Hurry up, Luke!

1011
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:11,470
Wait!

1012
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:20,510
Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.

1013
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:22,580
I'm on the leader.

1014
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:27,190
Hang on, Artoo!

1015
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:44,940
Use the Force, Luke.

1016
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:49,540
Let go, Luke.

1017
01:52:52,010 --> 01:52:54,200
The Force is strong with this one!

1018
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:55,680
Luke, trust me.

1019
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:04,520
His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your
targeting computer.

1020
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:07,060
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I'm all right.

1021
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:22,740
I've lost Artoo!

1022
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:28,060
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1023
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:31,780
Rebel base, in range.

1024
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:33,290
You may fire when ready.

1025
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:35,760
Commence primary ignition.

1026
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,040
I have you now.

1027
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,440
What?

1028
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,520
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1029
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:15,830
Stand by.

1030
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:20,600
Stand by.

1031
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:33,080
Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.

1032
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:38,150
Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

1033
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,850
-Hey! Hey!
-I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!

1034
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:08,530
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and
take all the reward.

1035
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:10,850
Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.

1036
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:16,510
Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something!

1037
01:55:17,290 --> 01:55:20,430
-You can repair him, can't you?
-We'll get to work on him right away.

1038
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,200
You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1039
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,600
He'll be all right.
